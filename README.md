### VSCODE 
Ready to use, just download it and spin it up in vscode, change the vsc folder to .vscode, chnage the compiler dir's to your own compiler dir, then press ctrl + shift + b to build with the tasks.json.

### CLion
CMakeLists.txt works fine, put the dll in with the executable in the cmake-build-debug dir
